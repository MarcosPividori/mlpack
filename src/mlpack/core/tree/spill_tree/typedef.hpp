/**
 * The hybrid spill tree.  It is a variant of metric-trees in which the children
 * of a node can "spill over" onto each other, and contain shared datapoints.
 *
 * When recursively splitting nodes, the SPTree class select the dimension with
 * maximum width to split on, and picks the midpoint of the range in that
 * dimension as the value on which to split nodes.
 *
 * In each case a "overlapping buffer" is defined, included points at a distance
 * less than tau from the decision boundary defined by the midpoint.
 *
 * For each node, we first split the points considering the overlapping buffer.
 * If either of its children contains more than rho fraction of the total points
 * we undo the overlapping splitting. Instead a conventional partition is used.
 * In this way, we can ensure that each split reduces the number of points of a
 * node by at least a constant factor.
 *
 * For more information, see the following paper.
